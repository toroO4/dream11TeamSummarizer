üèÜ ENHANCED ANALYSIS FEATURES DOCUMENTATION
================================================

This document contains the technical implementation details of the best analysis features 
that were successfully implemented in the cricbuzz11 Fantasy Cricket application.

=== 1. RECENT FORM (LAST 5 MATCHES) ===

üìç Backend Implementation (server.js):
- Endpoint: /api/team-recent-form
- Uses Supabase queries to get last 5 matches for each team before match date
- Calculates win/loss record with proper date filtering
- Query structure:
  ```sql
  SELECT matches WHERE (team1_id = teamId OR team2_id = teamId) 
  AND match_date < targetDate 
  ORDER BY match_date DESC LIMIT 5
  ```

üìç Frontend Display (script.js - displayTeamRecentForm):
- Shows form as "W-L-W-L-W" pattern with color coding
- Displays win percentage and match count
- Blue color scheme for professional look

üéØ Key Features:
- Accurate historical data based on actual match results
- Date-filtered to prevent data leakage
- Clean visual representation of team momentum

=== 2. LEADERSHIP PERFORMANCE (ROLE-BASED STATS) ===

üìç Backend Implementation (server.js):
- Endpoint: /api/player-performance
- Enhanced to fetch player roles from database
- Role-based stat filtering:
  ```javascript
  if (isBatsman) {
      primaryStat = avg runs, secondaryStat = last 5 scores
  } else if (isBowler) {
      primaryStat = avg wickets, secondaryStat = last 5 wickets
  } else {
      // All-rounder: both stats
  }
  ```

üìç Database Integration:
- Uses players table with role column (batsman, bowler, all-rounder, wicket-keeper)
- Joins with player_match_stats for performance data
- Last 5 matches performance with proper sorting

üìç Frontend Display (script.js - displayPlayerPerformance):
- Role-aware display showing relevant metrics
- For Batsmen: Average runs + individual scores (32, 45, 12, 67, 28)
- For Bowlers: Average wickets + individual figures (2, 1, 3, 0, 2)
- Color-coded: Captain (Yellow), Vice-Captain (Blue)

üéØ Key Features:
- Smart role detection from database
- Context-appropriate statistics display
- Historical performance tracking

=== 3. VENUE ANALYSIS (COMPREHENSIVE PITCH INSIGHTS) ===

üìç Backend Implementation (server.js):
- Endpoint: /api/venue-stats
- Multi-step Supabase approach:
  1. Find venue from match details
  2. Get historical matches at venue
  3. Calculate innings scores and wickets
  4. Analyze pitch characteristics
  5. Get team-specific venue performance

üìç Pitch Analysis Logic:
```javascript
// Scoring thresholds for pitch classification
if (avgScore >= 180 && avgWicketsPerMatch <= 12) {
    pitchType = 'batting'; pitchRating = 'high-scoring batting paradise';
} else if (avgScore >= 160 && avgWicketsPerMatch <= 14) {
    pitchType = 'batting'; pitchRating = 'good for batting';
} else if (avgScore <= 140 && avgWicketsPerMatch >= 16) {
    pitchType = 'bowling'; pitchRating = 'bowler-friendly surface';
} else if (avgScore <= 150 && avgWicketsPerMatch >= 15) {
    pitchType = 'bowling'; pitchRating = 'assists bowlers';
} else {
    pitchType = 'neutral'; pitchRating = 'balanced conditions';
}
```

üìç Enhanced Venue Data:
- Average first/second innings scores
- Chase success rate calculation
- Team-specific venue records
- Toss decision recommendation
- Pitch type classification (batting/bowling/neutral)

üìç Frontend Display (script.js - displayVenueStats):
- Color-coded pitch type badges (green=batting, red=bowling, yellow=neutral)
- Comprehensive venue information layout
- Team records at venue with win percentages
- Strategic toss recommendation

üéØ Key Features:
- Data-driven pitch classification
- Historical venue performance analysis
- Team-specific venue insights
- Strategic decision support

=== TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ===

üîß Database Schema Used:
- teams: team_id, team_name
- players: player_id, player_name, role, team_id
- matches: match_id, team1_id, team2_id, venue_id, match_date, winner_team_id
- player_match_stats: runs_scored, wickets_taken, match_id, player_id
- venues: venue_id, venue_name, city

üîß Query Optimization:
- Proper indexing on match_date, player_id, team_id
- Date filtering to prevent future data leakage
- Efficient joins using Supabase foreign key relationships

üîß Frontend Architecture:
- Parallel API calls for all analysis components
- Professional loading states and error handling
- Responsive card-based layout with Tailwind CSS
- Color-coded information hierarchy

=== RESTORATION GUIDE ===

To restore these features if modified:

1. Backend Endpoints:
   - Ensure /api/team-recent-form has proper date filtering
   - Verify /api/player-performance includes role fetching
   - Confirm /api/venue-stats has pitch analysis logic

2. Frontend Functions:
   - displayTeamRecentForm: W-L-W pattern display
   - displayPlayerPerformance: Role-based stat selection
   - displayVenueStats: Comprehensive venue card layout

3. Database Dependencies:
   - players.role column populated
   - matches.winner_team_id for form calculation
   - venues table for location data
